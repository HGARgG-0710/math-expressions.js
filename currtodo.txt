This file contains currently pursued TODOs and self-created tasks for the development of the library...; 

1 [main]. Generalize the old finite-type methods; 

	1.1. For that, first finish all the work related to the infinite types ('types', 'macros', 'counters' modules and all the related...); 

2 [side]. Code-brushing; Read code as you go along doing other things, make it 'tidier' and more liked; 
	2.1. Finish all the great amount of 'small' TODOs written all over the source code file; 
	2.2. Finish the finite methods; Create the stuff that was desired/planned but was not as of yet implemented within the library in question; 
	2.3. Re-view the older code, fix the leftover stuff from previous versions of the 'v1.0' version of the 'math-expressions.js'; 
	2.4. Fix the known bugs in advance; Look for them; 

3. DIRECTIONS: project is slowly entering a halting phase of development (again); 
	LIST OF CURRENTLY PURSUED TODOS: 
		[First off - the method of choice; The ones considered presently will all be of finishing/reparing/patching/fixing/generalizing/templatizing nature]
		1. Finish NumberEquation (based off the old Equation); 	
			1.1. First, simply understand the old method of work in detail, clean up, basic refactor, reconstruct it anew (with newly decided code practices); 
				1.1.1. The gist of it has been such - given a string being a sentence in a given language, the langauge is parsed and then converted to a two-side equation. 
						Then, one finds the difference of two sides and finds the values for variables that cause the difference to equal zero; 
						NOTE [1]: the thing works only with 1 sought variable - fix it? 
						The search is numerical purely and is done via manual substitution and decimal approximation; 
						NOTE [2]: this can only be limitedly useful and accurate. One ought to create and implement a class for unlimited decimals and decimal arithmetic; 
						After having computed an array of desired depth of accuracy and found the point of greatest accuracy, it is returned as an approximation for a solution; 
						NOTE [3]: doesn't seem to be taking account of the case of multiple possible answers; [If the case is that there are 2 or more equal smallest differences]
							So instead, return the array of them instaed;  
						NOTE [4]: two sides of the equation; 
							Approximation is currently taken via 'indexof(min|r-l|)'; 
							This strips the method of some degree of accuracy; 
							QUESTION: Make it so that it is possible to calulate it for both the sides [that is - there is the *signed* difference], or not? 
							ANSWER: currently - no; It doesn't give new information in regards of the minimal difference sought;  
						NOTE [5]: It appears to be using eval; Let it use library's 'op' API instead...

						NOTE [6]: The usage of finite strings; Again, as always with finite types - generalize to UnlimitedString [once having finally connected and defined it as an EXTENSION of the GeneralArray;]

			1.2. Then, generalize; 
		
		2. Finish the UnlimitedString; 
			2.1. Main: 
				2.1. Finish the missing methods from the UnlimiedString [this involves working with TrueNumbers, and also working with the .length().set()...]; 
				2.2. Add the missing GeneralArray methods to it... [those that became to be as a part of UnlimitedString in the implementation in question originally]; 
								
		3. PROBLEM: with replacing the old API with the new General types: 
			While an Idea of supreme beauty from the standpoint of structural integrity and the computational range potential [reference to the unlimitedness of the types], 
				because of this transformation, the speed of the things may suffer greatly [namely, the numerous function calls]; 
			
			SO: before finally replacing all the 'Old' native-based apis with the general stuff, pray first ensure the difference in performance; 
				IF, it is considered by oneself too great, then keep the things under a new name [such as '.fast', for instance...]; 
				ELSE do as was previously decided; 

		4. Work on the Elementarization of all the library bits [abstraction from the 'instance' function]; 
			6.1. Fix the references, pray...
