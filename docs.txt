These are the outlines of the documentation (work-sketch...): 

	The documenation consists of: 

		1. The list of items (exports). 
			As-is enumeration of library items. Each gets its own page.
		2. Pages for _each_ item. 
			They would contain a brief description, a link to the source and tests examples (if any). 
			ONLY THAT! NO STUFF REGARDING PRECISE WORKFLOW OR GIMMICKS/ISSUES-WITH-CURRENT-DEFINITION, NOTHING MORE THAN THAT. 
			NOT FOR THE V1.0ALPHA!
