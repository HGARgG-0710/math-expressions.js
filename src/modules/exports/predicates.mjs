// * This sourcefile encompases some aliases for the commonly used elementary predicates' generalizations (allow for greater simplification of the code);

// ? Make 'predicates' a sub-module of the 'aliases'? Or keep separate and develop it into something new entirely? 
// ! Extend this - refactor the library hardcorely in the sense of repeating expressions and distribute all the appropriate ones in here;
